This project aims to explore data exported from Gmail, [using Justin Ellis' excellent write-up as a guide](https://jellis18.github.io/post/2018-01-17-mail-analysis/).

You can download any Google data you own [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) and set up Jupyter notebooks [with these instructions](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

My analysis
- I downloaded emails I sent with a specific category label, focusing on when I sent those emails.
- I sliced them by whether I was employed or not, where I was working, day of week, and hour of the day.
- I found that I sent these emails most often on weekday mornings around 8am.
